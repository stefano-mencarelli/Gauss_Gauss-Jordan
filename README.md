# Gauss_Gauss-Jordan

# The code included in this repository is just a little part of a university project, which my team and I created, developed and implemented. A web application has been developed in order to solve a typical problem in the field of Operational Resarch: "The Transport Problem". The webapp is entirely written in HTML + JS, in order to be 100% transparent and accessible to anyone. It uses the API of Google in order to obtain distances between sources and destinations. To calculate the optimal solution, a dual problem has to be created and solved. Variables values have been calculated by Gauss-Jordan-Algorithm. The source code posted here, belongs to Gauss-Jordan-Algorithm implementation.
